# gpx-to-leaflet

Python script illustrating how to generate a HTML page with a Leaflet map showing a GPX track.

I have created a short blog post about the script here: [https://dev.to/coderallan/gpx-track-to-leaflet-map-3m93](https://dev.to/coderallan/gpx-track-to-leaflet-map-3m93)

And a followup post about calculating the distance and duration of the gpx track here: [https://dev.to/coderallan/distance-and-duration-of-you-hiking-trip-29dj](https://dev.to/coderallan/distance-and-duration-of-you-hiking-trip-29dj)

## Usage

In you command prompt just run:
`python gpxToLeaflet.py`

Have a look at some of the other good articles on [Dev about Leaflet](https://dev.to/search?q=leaflet).
