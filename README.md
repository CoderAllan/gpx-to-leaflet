# gpx-to-leaflet

Python script illustrating how to generate a HTML page with a Leaflet map showing a GPX track.

I have created a series of short blog posts about the script here

* About the Python script and generating the HTML and JavaScript: [https://dev.to/coderallan/gpx-track-to-leaflet-map-3m93](https://dev.to/coderallan/gpx-track-to-leaflet-map-3m93)
* Calculating the distance and duration of the gpx track here: [https://dev.to/coderallan/distance-and-duration-of-you-hiking-trip-29dj](https://dev.to/coderallan/distance-and-duration-of-you-hiking-trip-29dj)
* Adding markers to the Leaflet map: [https://dev.to/coderallan/distance-and-duration-of-you-hiking-trip-29dj](https://dev.to/coderallan/distance-and-duration-of-you-hiking-trip-29dj)
* Clicking the track and calculating the distance from start to the clicked point: [https://dev.to/coderallan/leaflet-onclick-event-1468](https://dev.to/coderallan/leaflet-onclick-event-1468)

## Usage

You have to provide your own myTrack.gpx file and place it in the folder next to the script.

Then in you command prompt just run:
`python gpxToLeaflet.py`

Have a look at some of the other good articles on [Dev about Leaflet](https://dev.to/search?q=leaflet).
