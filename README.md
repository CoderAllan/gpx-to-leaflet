# gpx-to-leaflet

Python script illustrating how to generate a HTML page with a Leaflet map showing a GPX track.

I have created a short blog post about the script here: [https://dev.to/coderallan/gpx-track-to-leaflet-map-3m93](https://dev.to/coderallan/gpx-track-to-leaflet-map-3m93)

## Usage

In you command prompt just run:
`python gpxToLeaflet.py`

Have a look at some of the other good articles on [Dev about Leaflet](https://dev.to/search?q=leaflet).
